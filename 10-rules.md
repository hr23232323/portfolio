Over the past 7 weeks, I have had the opportunity to learn about designing smart technology. Here's a list of <b>10 rules/commandments</b> that I have made for myself to follow. I've developed them using personal experience, readings and some more personal experience. Feel free to use them; or not, as your own. <br><br>

<!-- Table 1 -->
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
  <td style="width:20%">
    <p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/comm1.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 200px; padding: 0 10px; float: left;"></p>
  </td>
  <td style="width:80%">
    <p style="margin-top:20px;"></p>
    <h3><b>1.</b> What's the correct problem?</h3>
    <p>Before starting any design ideating or process, one must always ask "am I solving the right problem? Don Norman put it best when he <a href = "https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/reading/DesignThinking_DonNorman.pdf"> said </a>"A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all." <br>
    I fall for the millennials trap very often: when I start the process of solving before even defining the problem. Look at my <a href="https://medium.com/@hayley.boigenzahn/design-for-tension-da9bfcb260cb">Design for Tension</a> project for a wonderful example where me and my teammates got excited about a problem only to realize that it wasn't meeting the task given to us. </p>

    <h3><b>2.</b> When starting, no idea is a bad idea</h3>
    <p>One of the big traps that I consistently fell for while brainstorming, was getting too focused very early on. It was not until the 4th week while working with my teammates on <a href = "https://medium.com/@yzhang0331/design-for-wellbeing-83e813ff1233">Design for Wellbeing</a>, that I realized the importance of staying broad (especially early on). We came up with many fantastic ideas including a <i>meditation app</i> and a <i>movie recommendation app</i>. The breadth of the ideas came in handy, when we realized the constraints that we were going to face with the Affectiva Library, and had to change our topic all together.  </p>

<!-- Table 3 -->
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
  <td style="width:20%">
    <p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/comm3.png" style="max-height: 200px; max-width: 200px; padding: 0 10px; float: left;"></p>
  </td>
  <td style="width:80%">
    <p style="margin-top:20px;"></p>
    <h3><b>3.</b> Around the world in 6 days?</h3>
    <p>In the movie <i>Around the World in 80 days</i>, 3 adventurers take on the task of circling the globe. While no one (at the time) thought this was possible, they did so and did it within the time frame. The point that I'm trying to make is that when deciding the scope for your project, it is important to place heavy importance on two factors: the skills of the people and the time available. <br>
    Again, take a look at my <a href="https://medium.com/@hayley.boigenzahn/design-for-tension-da9bfcb260cb">Design for Tension</a> project to see the scope we originally decided as a team and our final product. There's a reason why the movie isn't named "<b>Around the World in 6 days</b>"</p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;"></p>
    <h3><b>4.</b> Be inconsistent wisely</h3>
    <p>While it is great practice to break the norm and think outside the box, doing so should always serve a purpose. In this situation, where the image and text are not alternated, breaking the alternating flow serves no purposes and could've been completely avoided. Thus, when you're breaking consistency, make sure you have a reason. </p>

    <h3><b>5.</b> Law of Proximity</h3>
    <p>This one is pretty simple: elements in close proximity of each other <br>
    tend to be perceived as together. This is one of Gestalt's Principles <br>
    and I believe it to be very powerful when creating designs. Going back <br>
    to the previous point, here breaking the pattern serves a purpose :)

    <p><b>6.</b> Visual Hierarchy can be extremely powerful when understood, and quite the disaster when not. I've found it quite the tool to have in my designing toolset and you can read about it more <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/3-ways-to-improve-your-visual-design-skills-fa9dc8e583ff">here</a>.

    <h3><b>7.</b> People like feeling smart</h3>
    <p>One of the key factors I've kept in mind while working on my projects this term, is how I make my user feel. No one in the world likes to feel stupid and inferior, and that fact is only exemplified when someone is a user of your products. <br>The image on the left shouldn't be there because most people will not understand difficult calculus, and you don't want them using your website feeling inferior. </p>

    <h3><b>8.</b> Sometimes you're not the smartest person in the room</h3>
    <p>Over the past couple of weeks, one of the biggest realizations I've had is that people always say things because they felt a certain way. Often when designing, the creators assume that their methods are working and are also the best way to go about things. They could not be further from the truth. <br> <b>User testing, getting feedback and making changes</b> might be the most important step in the design process and I cannot stress that enough. Every tester will help you better your design, <i>if you let them</i>. </p>

    <h3><b>9.</b> Prägnanz: Simple is good</h3>
    <p>The Law of Prägnanz states that <i>"People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form(s) possible."</i> Over and over again, these past few weeks, my teammates and I have learnt that simple is better. Say goodbye to highly complex designs/products and welcome the world of <a href="http://carla-izumi-bamford.com/10-principles-of-minimalist-design/">minimalism</a>. </p>

    <h3><b>10.</b> Your biggest asset: <b>You're human</b></h3>
    <p>At the end of the day, designing is not a simplex science. It is a highly complex combination of art and science, further complexed by the interactions with many different users. If something doesn't work, don't take it too personally. Get back to the white board and start over. Rinse. Repeat.</p>
